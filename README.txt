QUIZZLE was made using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and PHP. We used XAMPP as our test server, so to get it up and running, we'd recommend downloading that or WAMP. If XAMPP is installed, go to your xampp folder, then the htdocs folder, then put the quizzle folder there. Go to phpMyAdmin and import the quizzle sql file. Create a user in phpMyAdmin with username="admin" and password="". Run XAMPP in administrator, and start Apache and MySQL. You can then navigate to http://localhost/Quizzle/views/index.php.
